        <h1>How to play blackjack</h1>
        <hr>

        <h2>Start</h2>
        <div>
            In blackjack start by the players placing bets, after bets are placed the dealer start dealing cards around
            the
            table until all players inculding the dealer has 2 cards. All player cards are faceup, while the first
            dealer
            card is shown but the seccond is facedown.
        </div>
        <hr>

        <h2>Goal of the game</h2>
        <div>
            In blackjack you play aganist the dealer and not the other players, the goal of the game is to get a hand
            (all
            the cards you have) to be worth 21. If you have over 21 you "bust" meaning you lose automatically.
        </div>
        <hr>

        <h2>Cards</h2>
        <div>
            In blackjack cards have their numbers as their worth and, all cards without numbers (king, queen, jack) all
            count as 10. The A is a little more special as it can have the value of a 1 or 11. A hand with A and 5 would
            be
            a "soft" 16.
        </div>
        <hr>

        <h2>Turns</h2>
        <div>
            <div>
                Then one player at the time can decide what they want to do on their turn. there are 4 possible
                actions in
                blackjack you can do on your turn, "hit", "stand", "dobble" and "split"
            </div>
            <hr>

            <div>**Hit:**</div>
            <div>
                If the player "hit" they will be delt one more card, then they can decide their action again
            </div>
            <hr>

            <div>**Stand:**</div>
            <div>
                If the player "stands" they will end their turn.
            </div>
            <hr>

            <div>**Dobble:**</div>
            <div>
                If the player dobbles, they get one more card just like hit but they also dobble their original bet. but
                after
                they have dobbled their turn ends. meaning you cant hit anymore after a dobble.
            </div>
            <hr>

            <div>**Split:**</div>
            <div>
                Split the player can only do this if they have to identical cards in value. When splitting the players
                hand is
                divided into two SEPRART hands, on the new hand the player places a equal bet to the first hand. The
                hands gets
                delt one card each. The hands are player invidually where you cando your actions.
            </div>
        </div>
        <hr>

        <h2>Blackjack</h2>
        <div>
            Blackjack is the best hand a player can get and its when a player gets 21 on their fist two cards. Blackjack
            grants a win over a normal 21 but pushes against dealer having blackjack. The payout for winning with a
            blackjack is 1 and a half times more than u bet or (3 to 2)
